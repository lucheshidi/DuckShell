CMake Warning (dev) at D:/msys64/ucrt64/share/cmake/Modules/FetchContent.cmake:1963 (message):
  Calling FetchContent_Populate(minizip_src) is deprecated, call
  FetchContent_MakeAvailable(minizip_src) instead.  Policy CMP0169 can be set
  to OLD to allow FetchContent_Populate(minizip_src) to be called directly
  for now, but the ability to call it with declared details will be removed
  completely in a future version.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:32 (FetchContent_Populate)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
